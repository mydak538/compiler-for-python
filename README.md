# compiler-for-python
this is the python compiler.
I say right away, to make an installer for the nsis script, you need to place the compiledet folder on your desktop. 
I immediately ask you to make an installer in installer.nis, you need to specify your path to the folder on the desktop.
but I've uploaded a ready-made installer that saves the program in C:\Programs Files (x84)\MyApp is there uninstaller.exe to remove the installer,
the compiler supports only the Russian language.
